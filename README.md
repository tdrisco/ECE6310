Computer Vision

Course Description:

The purpose of a computer vision system is to take data (usually in the form of one or more images) and produce information. For example, a computer vision system might inspect bottles for proper volumes, identify abnormal tissue in a medical image, recognize a fingerprint to allow entry to a building, or tell an automated door when it is safe to close. This course teaches the mainstream theories of computer vision used to build such systems. Several examples (such as optical character recognition) are implemented in assignments. It is assumed the student has a solid mathematical background and is proficient in C programming.
